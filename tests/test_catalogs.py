"""
We want to test the following:
1. Create example (smaller) catalog to test and freeze.
2. Check subhalos are actually subhalos when pass in argument.
3. Check when relaxed argument it is actually relaxed according to correct criteria
4. Load a catalog with default params and check they are all there.
5. Check default filters are applied appropriately
6. Check it has expected number of rows, etc.

6. Define arbitrary filters and params_to_include and see if this works too


Later:
7. Check generator works properly.
