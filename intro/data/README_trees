Bolshoi Trees Public Release, version 1.53.  (6/20/2015).

Each "tree" file contains complete merger histories for halos in a (50 Mpc/h)^3 subvolume
of Bolshoi.  There are 125 files in total, labeled as tree_X_Y_Z.dat, all in ASCII format.

Each tree file begins with an explanatory header followed by a number on a single line,
which refers to the total number of merger trees contained in the file.  Every halo and
subhalo at z=0 will have a distinct merger tree; trees are delineated within the file
with "#tree XYZ" tags, where XYZ is the ID of the z=0 halo.

Halos in a merger tree are stored with one line per halo.  The are presented in breadth-first
order, meaning that all the halos in the merger tree at one scale factor are grouped together.
Alternate indices (i.e., the depth-first order index) are also included to facilitate alternate
tree-walking approaches.  The details of what is in each column is contained in the header of
the tree; this includes halo positions, velocities, masses, and many other useful properties.

There are also two other useful files.  "forests.list" contains a list of z=0 halo ids (tree root ids) and the
corresponding forest ID.  If two halos share the same forest ID, then their merger trees
have cross-references to each other (as may happen for subhalos at z=0 or for flyby halos).
Loading in all trees in a forest guarantees that there are no cross-references outside the
forest.  The second useful file, "locations.dat", contains a list of z=0 halo ids and the
corresponding filename and location where the tree data is stored.  Because z=0 halo ids
are contiguous, it is straightforward to use a plain array structure to store the contents
of both files.

Note: Previous issues concerning T/|U|, the Peebles spin parameter, and the
next_coprogenitor_depthfirst_id have been corrected in these catalogs.
This version also corrects an issue affecting the MMP flag and includes a new field
(last_mainleaf_depthfirst_ID) to help with extracting main progenitor histories.
